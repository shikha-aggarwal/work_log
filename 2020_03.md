### 15 March 2021
- CS224N - Lecture 6
    - Language modeling,
    - RNNs,
    - Evaluation of LM (perplexity)
- CS224N - Lecture 7
    - Vanishing/exploding Gradient in RNNs.
    - LSTM, GRU - mitigate.
    - Very good lecture about minute details in handling gradients.
    - Optimizations: Residual, Dense, and Highway connections.
    - Bidirectional and Multi-layer RNNs.
- CS224N - Lecture 8
    - Machine translation problem,
    - SMT,
    - NMT -- started with seq-to-seq.
    - seq-to-seq consists of Encoder RNN and decoder RNN.
    - BLEU score.
    - Excellent intuition of Attention! Idea: on each step of the decoder, use direct connection to the encoder to focus on a particular part of the source sequence.
    - Generalization of attention.
    - Variants of attention scores: dot-product, multiplicative attention, additive.
