### The road not taken
Just as Frost pondered paths untrodden, [this code](https://github.com/shikha-aggarwal/llm_serving/tree/main/demo) reveals the roads the LLM didn’t take — the alternative outputs it could have chosen at each iteration.

It also allows to play with temperature and top_p parameters discussed in [previous notes](https://github.com/shikha-aggarwal/work_log/blob/main/2025_10_30.md) to see how they affect the output.
