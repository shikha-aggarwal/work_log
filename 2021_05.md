- Trivia model: model is probably training.
- Pushed code to Github: https://github.com/shikha-aggarwal/question_answering/tree/main/trivia

### 04 May 2021
- Encountered so many issues:
  - pl.lightning class initialization was taking super long: was writing a huge - 0.5 GB hparams.yaml file on startup. Could not find anything to avoid it.
  - Figured it could have been the hparams.Dataset :D
- Then training step was failing with "worker killed" error. It failed with a different stack trace each time. So, had to be memory issue. Closed other notebooks on Colab and it worked. 1.5 hours gone.
- I think tomorrow will be the last day I encounter such gems and will get the code working. So close! Satisfying to pay the price to learn. This is how I learnt to code.

### 05 May 2021
- Got the t5 on trivia dataset working!! Almost a week spent, but got there!
- Fixed some more errors, tested on smaller dataset.
  - had issues in dataloader: finally used set_format on dataset.
  - added checkpoint save.
  - tested loading and generation from checkpoint.
  - tensorboard logger is working now.
  - validation works.
- Still need to reformat into different lightning modules to make the code more readable.

### 06 May 2021
- Interview. Worked on citations dataset. Will try to finish it and see the results.

### 07 May 2021
- Cleaned up T5 notebook.
- Train-complete model for citations dataset: https://github.com/shikha-aggarwal/researchpaperlikes/blob/main/text_classification.ipynb
- Next QA problem: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview Starting with first prize repo: https://github.com/oleg-yaroshevskiy/quest_qa_labeling
