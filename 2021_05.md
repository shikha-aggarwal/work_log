- Trivia model: model is probably training.
- Pushed code to Github: https://github.com/shikha-aggarwal/question_answering/tree/main/trivia

- Encountered so many issues:
  - pl.lightning class initialization was taking super long: was writing a huge - 0.5 GB hparams.yaml file on startup. Could not find anything to avoid it.
  - Figured it could have been the hparams.Dataset :D
- Then training step was failing with "worker killed" error. It failed with a different stack trace each time. So, had to be memory issue. Closed other notebooks on Colab and it worked. 1.5 hours gone.
- I think tomorrow will be the last day I encounter such gems and will get the code working. So close! Satisfying to pay the price to learn. This is how I learnt to code.
