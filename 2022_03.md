- [Experimentation in a ridesharing marketplace](https://eng.lyft.com/experimentation-in-a-ridesharing-marketplace-b39db027a66e): 
    - Interference across a network - occurs when the group assignment of unit A changes any of the potential outcomes of unit B.
    -  Average treatment effect, Randomize app sessions, spatial units (square blocks to entire cities), time intervals.
- [Multi-armed bandits](https://medium.com/elemeno/multi-armed-bandits-an-introduction-b51642724e12):
    - Exploitation vs Exploration,
    - Value Estimation (Sample-Average),
    - Greedy Agent,
    - Optimistic Initial Values (large initial values)
    - Epsilon-Greedy Agent, --decay epsilon
    - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Action Selection
    - Gradient Bandits
- [Multi-armed bandits vs A/B testing](https://medium.com/elemeno/multi-armed-bandits-vs-a-b-testing-a-comparison-26282a73a292):
    - The crucial drawback of the A/B testing method is not exploiting its current knowledge.
    - It fails to address the problems posed by non-stationary distributions. People’s preferences change over time. The central problem is a lack of ongoing exploration.
    - MAB tests focus jointly on testing and optimizing the business metric at the same time.
    - Welch’s t-test for statistical significance ought to be used for unequal sample sizes obtained in MAB.
- [Simulating a ridesharing marketplace](https://eng.lyft.com/https-medium-com-adamgreenhall-simulating-a-ridesharing-marketplace-36007a8a31f2):
    - Expectations: Accurate, Fast (Scalable), Easy to use
    - use production code
- [Bias and Variation in Simulation](https://eng.lyft.com/experimentation-in-a-ridesharing-marketplace-f75a9c4fcf01):
    - Example: Simulate subsidizing prime time pricing.
    - Treatment and control groups: alternating time intervals (one hour), randomized spatial units (geohashes), randomized user sessions.
    - Metrics: availability, ETA, number of completed rides normalized by group size
    - Measure percent change in the metric in treatment group relative to control group.

- Welch's t-test: student's t-test is for equal variances, Welch's for different variances - to test the hypothesis of equal population means.
- Quazi-experimental Methods: do not use randomization to select the control group. Require larger sample sizes and more assumptions.
    - difference-in-differences: compares the changes in outcomes over time between treatment and comparison group.
    - Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD): Assignment based on some clear-cut threshold (or cutoff point) of an observed variable such as age, income, and score. estimates local average treatment effects around the cutoff point.
    - Matching: the researcher uses statistical techniques to construct an artificial control group by matching each treated unit with a non-treated unit of similar characteristics. Requires extensive datasets with information on units.

- [Matchmaking in Lyft Line](https://eng.lyft.com/matchmaking-in-lyft-line-9c2635fe62c4#.le50784zs):
    - step 1. Simulation in Classic rides suggested that over 80% of rides shared routes [50% of ride and 10 minutes of detour if paired].
    - step 2. initial designs: 1 minute wait to look for match, 10 minute bucket interval, variable bucket interval. But, supply shock (drivers) towards end of bucket; and longer wait for some passengers.
    - Naive matching: greedy haversine - take the first match that satisfies constraints (detours, time until pickup). O(n^2) orderings for A-A' and B-B'. But consider only 4 (no overlap, pickup before drop off, etc.). Most optimal ordering is the one with total matched distance is minimum.
        - detour: delay below absolute threshold and below proportional threshold. For ABAB ordering, A's detour = ABA minus AA and B's = BAB minus BB.
        - additional time until pickup ($ is driver): for ABAB, A's pickup time = $A and B's = $AB.
    - Learned that passengers didn’t want to go backwards, and in fact the angle of the lines they saw on the map would affect their satisfaction with the match. (other side of a mountain route or additional loop through crowded downtown one-way streets.)
- [Part 2](https://eng.lyft.com/matchmaking-in-lyft-line-691a1a32a008)
    - Improving greedy haversine: A\* algorithm, contraction hierarchies
    - But easy implementation: hashtable with average speed between geohashes \* haversine distance
    - (add nested hashtable for each hour of the week)
    - More experiential issues: Users didnt like going backwards or long pickup time (but ok with longer detour).
    - Triple Matching: more scaling issues. bad experience was ABCDBCDA, riders incorrectly reporting number of passengers, full car, etc. -- more constraints.
        - Longitudinal Sorting: sort "outer and inner loops" by longitudes and break when 15 minutes apart (pickup time difference).
        - Rerouting: gains from rerouting the driver from current destination - guards against customer drop-off being one block away or driver about to get on freeway, etc.

- [Part 3](https://eng.lyft.com/finding-a-needle-in-a-haystack-b7e0627b01f6)
    - Efficiencies (moving away from greedy): Route Swapping. Allowed more time to search though only swapped if less pickup/detour than previously promised.
    - Matching Exchange: real time graph partitioning, small bucket window.
    - hotspots and standby options.

### 14 Mar 2022
- [Parameter Exploration](https://eng.lyft.com/parameter-exploration-at-lyft-b9d2a1483c82): continous parameter space, eg. amount of time a rider should expect to wait. running multivariate user split experiments or a series of time-split experiments.
    - can extrapolate between two tested values, it is tedious to run multiple experiments, optimal value could shift over time.
    - Solution: Bayesian Optimization over Gaussian Processes.
        - Gausian Process: a collection of random variables such that every finite collection of them has a multivariate normal distribution.
        - Bayesian Optimization: for problems where f(x) is a black box with unknown structure, less than 20 dimensions, and derivatives are not evaluated.
            - treat f(x) as a random function and place a prior (Gaussian in this case).
