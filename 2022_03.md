- [Experimentation in a ridesharing marketplace](https://eng.lyft.com/experimentation-in-a-ridesharing-marketplace-b39db027a66e): 
    - Interference across a network - occurs when the group assignment of unit A changes any of the potential outcomes of unit B.
    -  Average treatment effect, Randomize app sessions, spatial units (square blocks to entire cities), time intervals.
- [Multi-armed bandits](https://medium.com/elemeno/multi-armed-bandits-an-introduction-b51642724e12):
    - Exploitation vs Exploration,
    - Value Estimation (Sample-Average),
    - Greedy Agent,
    - Optimistic Initial Values (large initial values)
    - Epsilon-Greedy Agent, --decay epsilon
    - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Action Selection
    - Gradient Bandits
- [Multi-armed bandits vs A/B testing](https://medium.com/elemeno/multi-armed-bandits-vs-a-b-testing-a-comparison-26282a73a292):
    - The crucial drawback of the A/B testing method is not exploiting its current knowledge.
    - It fails to address the problems posed by non-stationary distributions. People’s preferences change over time. The central problem is a lack of ongoing exploration.
    - MAB tests focus jointly on testing and optimizing the business metric at the same time.
    - Welch’s t-test for statistical significance ought to be used for unequal sample sizes obtained in MAB.
- [Simulating a ridesharing marketplace](https://eng.lyft.com/https-medium-com-adamgreenhall-simulating-a-ridesharing-marketplace-36007a8a31f2):
    - Expectations: Accurate, Fast (Scalable), Easy to use
    - use production code
- [Bias and Variation in Simulation](https://eng.lyft.com/experimentation-in-a-ridesharing-marketplace-f75a9c4fcf01):
    - Example: Simulate subsidizing prime time pricing.
    - Treatment and control groups: alternating time intervals (one hour), randomized spatial units (geohashes), randomized user sessions.
    - Metrics: availability, ETA, number of completed rides normalized by group size
    - Measure percent change in the metric in treatment group relative to control group.

- Welch's t-test: student's t-test is for equal variances, Welch's for different variances - to test the hypothesis of equal population means.
- Quazi-experimental Methods: do not use randomization to select the control group. Require larger sample sizes and more assumptions.
    - difference-in-differences: compares the changes in outcomes over time between treatment and comparison group.
    - Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD): Assignment based on some clear-cut threshold (or cutoff point) of an observed variable such as age, income, and score. estimates local average treatment effects around the cutoff point.
    - Matching: the researcher uses statistical techniques to construct an artificial control group by matching each treated unit with a non-treated unit of similar characteristics. Requires extensive datasets with information on units.
